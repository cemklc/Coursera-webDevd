        Jabba the Hutt exemplifies lust, greed, and gluttony.[21] The character is known throughout the Star Wars
        universe as a "vile gangster"[22] who amuses himself by torturing and humiliating his subjects and enemies. He
        surrounds himself with scantily-clad slave girls of all species,
        chained to his dais. The Star Wars Databank remarks that residents of his palace are not safe from his desire to
        dominate and torture:[23] in Return of the Jedi, the Twi'lek slave dancer Oola is fed to Jabba's pet rancor.[24]
        Jabba the Hutt's physical appearance reinforces his personality as a
        criminal deviant. In Return of the Jedi, Han Solo calls Jabba a "slimy piece of worm-ridden filth". Film critic
        Roger Ebert described him as "a cross between a toad and the Cheshire Cat."[25] Curiously, the Russian/Ukrainian
        word for "toad" (жаба / zhaba) sounds very close to "Jabba", while in Arabic حُوت (ḥūt) means "fish / whale".
